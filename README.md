# EDA for SAheart Dataset

## Overview

Welcome to the "EDA for SAheart Dataset and Chapter 2 Exercise Answers" repository! This project serves two main purposes:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for SAheart Dataset:** This repository contains code and documentation for performing EDA on the SAheart dataset. The dataset is commonly used for studying risk factors associated with heart disease in South Africa. It includes various health and lifestyle features, and the target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

2. **Chapter 2 Exercise Answers:** Additionally, this repository includes a Jupyter Notebook titled `Chapter_2_Exercises_Answers.ipynb`. This notebook provides answers to exercises from Chapter 2 of the book "Machine Learning using Python" by Manaranjan Pradhan and U Dinesh Kumar. You can use this resource to check your solutions and further enhance your understanding of machine learning concepts.

## Dataset Description

The SAheart dataset consists of the following columns or features:

1. **sbp (Systolic Blood Pressure)**: The systolic blood pressure of the individual.

2. **tobacco**: The amount of tobacco use by the individual (in pack-years).

3. **ldl (Low-Density Lipoprotein)**: The level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

4. **adiposity**: A measure of body adiposity.

5. **famhist (Family History)**: A binary variable indicating whether the individual has a family history of heart disease (Present/Absent).

6. **typea (Type A Behavior)**: A measure of Type A behavior.

7. **obesity**: A measure of obesity.

8. **alcohol**: The amount of alcohol consumption (in ounces per day).

9. **age**: The age of the individual.

10. **chd (Coronary Heart Disease)**: The target variable, indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of coronary heart disease.

## EDA Steps

The EDA process for the SAheart dataset involved the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to gain an initial understanding of its structure and contents.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the dataset by addressing missing values.

4. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, and correlation matrices, to visualize the relationships between variables.
